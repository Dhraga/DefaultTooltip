## A lightweight tooltip that has everything you need.

**This tooltip includes the following features.**

* Display Target of Target.
* Display the state of your character when you're either afk, dnd or disconnected.
* Display the item ID when holding the ctrl modifier.
* Change the health bar's color based on your current health condition.
* Change the default background's color to transparent black.

**How can I change the default position?**

You can do that by typing /dtt to the chat, then you can use the frame to move it around, the tooltip will anchor itself to this frame when its appropriate.

**How positioning works?**

* The position of the tooltip for world objects is fixed to the objects themselves rather than to the drag frame.
* The position of the tooltip for UI elements is fixed to the drag frame except when it comes to LDB plugins which is handled differently so they should stay at their normal location.

**How can I reset, change, copy or delete a Profile?**

Open the interface options and select the AddOns tab, select DefaultTooltip and go to Profiles.
